Tell me about a project youâ€™re particularly proud of. What did you do that worked out well?
  I like the Checkpoint that I am working on. I am finally getting the hang of how the routes work.
  
How do you do testing, and what do you think about it? How would you improve QA?
I use postman. I also try to de-bug on VS code.

What tools do you use to find a performance bug?
W3 schools.

What is the preferred method of resolving unhandled exceptions in Node.js?
Google it.

How does Node.js support multi-processor platforms, and does it fully utilize all processor resources?
  Since Node.js is by default a single thread application, it will run on a single processor core and will not take full advantage of multiple core resources.

What is typically the first argument passed to a Node.js callback handler?
  Traditionally, the first parameter of the callback is the error value. If the function hits an error, then they typically call the callback with the first parameter being an Error object.
